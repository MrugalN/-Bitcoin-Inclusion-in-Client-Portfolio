# Bitcoin-Inclusion-in-Client-Portfolio
Getting Rich on Crypto 
Dan Nickerson, a private wealth manager at a big firm, had just begun taking on his first set of 
clients when one of them asked his advice on whether he should add bitcoin to his investment 
portfolio. Nickerson noticed that the price of one bitcoin had risen from $276.30 in March 2015, 
to $20,089.00 in December 2017, and closed on March 2, 2018, at $10,977.40. This represented 
an almost unprecedented amount of volatility when compared to other asset classes, but also an 
incredibly impressive return over a short period of time. News about bitcoin was contradictory, 
with some analysts suggesting that bitcoin could replace gold as a means to hedge the risk of other 
asset classes and balance a diversified portfolio while still providing a positive return. Nickerson 
wondered how to advise his client.

For this group case assignment, please answer the following questions in your group writeups. 
Writeups should be a maximum of 4 pages as pdf files, plus Excel spreadsheets (if any), and 
submitted on HuskyCT by November 24.  
For all the questions, assuming that SPDR Bloomberg Barclays T-Bill is the risk-free asset (i.e., 
the risk-free rate equals this T-Bill Rate and the standard deviation of this T-Bill’s daily return is 
0). Also, assuming that his client cannot short sell any assets. Please use the data in the attached 
spreadsheets to answer all the questions. 
1. What were the average daily return and the daily volatility (standard deviation) of the 
current assets in his client’s portfolio? (10 points) 
2. What was the variance-covariance matrix of all the risky assets in his client’s portfolio? 
(10 points) 
3. What were the average daily return and the daily volatility (standard deviation) of his 
client’s portfolio?  (5 points)  
4. What was the Sharpe Ratio of his client’s portfolio? (5 points) hint: Use SPDR Bloomberg 
Barclays T-Bill rate as the risk-free rate 
5. Use all the risky assets in his client’s portfolio to construct an efficient frontier and plot it 
as Chart 1. (10 points) hint: SPDR Bloomberg Barclays T-Bill is not considered as a risky 
asset 
6. Find the tangency portfolio on the efficient frontier and add the Capital Allocation Line to 
Chart 1. (10 points) 
7. Is his client’s portfolio currently optimized? (5 points) hint: compare its Sharpe ratio to 
the Sharpe ratio of the tangency portfolio 
8. What were the average daily return and the daily volatility (standard deviation) of Bitcoin? 
(5 points) 
9. What will be the variance-covariance matrix of all the risky assets in his client’s portfolio 
plus Bitcoin? (5 points) 
10. Use all the risky assets in his client’s portfolio plus Bitcoin to add a new efficient frontier 
to Chart 1. From which frontier would you prefer to choose your investments? (10 points) 
11. Find the new tangency portfolio on the new efficient frontier and add the new Capital 
Allocation Line to Chart 1. (10 points) 
12. What is the average daily return, the daily volatility, and the Sharpe Ratio of his client’s 
new portfolio with Bitcoin included? (5 points) 
13. Should he recommend his client to invest in bitcoin? (10 points) 
14. If he decided to recommend investing in Bitcoin, and his client is only willing to take the 
same level of risk as his current portfolio (measured by the daily volatility), what will be 
the optimal weight of each asset in his client’s new portfolio? (5 bonus points) hint: the 
optimal portfolio lies somewhere on the new capital allocation line.
